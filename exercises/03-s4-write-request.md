# Create a write request to SAP S/4HANA
Approving locally stored appointments shall create an appointment in SAP S/4HANA. Let's write back to SAP S/4HANA. For that we need to create an entity to be written and then actually write it.

## Build a TimeSheetEntry
Find the *TODO* in the `buildTimeSheetEntry` function in [src/write-appointments.ts](../src/write-appointments.ts). Instead of returning `null` create a `TimeSheetEntry`. You can try to implement this on your own using the following hints or peek at the [solution](SOLUTION.md#build-a-timesheetentry) and copy the implementation.

Use the `TimeSheetEntry.builder()` to build a `TimeSheetEntry`. Set the following properties using the builders' fluent API:

* `personWorkAgreementExternalId` should be `externalId`
* `timeSheetDataFields` should be `timeSheetDataFields`
* `companyCode` should be `companyCode`
* `timeSheetStatus` should be `status`
* `timeSheetDate` should be `day`
* `timeSheetIsReleasedOnSave` should be `isReleasedOnSave`
* `timeSheetIsExecutedInTestRun` should be * `isExecutedInTestRun`
* `timeSheetOperation` should be `operation`

In the end build the entity using `.build()`.

## Write a TimeSheetEntry
Find the *TODO* in the `writeTimeSheetEntry` function in [src/write-appointments.ts](../src/write-appointments.ts). Instead of just returning the `TimeSheetEntry` that was passed to the function, implement a request to create this entity in SAP S/4HANA.

You can try to implement this on your own using the following hints or or peek at the [solution](SOLUTION.md#write-a-timesheetentry) and copy the implementation.

Use the `TimeSheetEntry.requestBuilder()` to implement a request to create a `TimeSheetEntry`. Pass the given entry.

Execute this request against the destination with the `destinationName` *S4HANA*.

Refresh your application in the browser and try to approve a request. This request should now be written to SAP S/4HANA.
